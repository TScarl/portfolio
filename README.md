# Thomas Scarlett's Portfolio

## Introduction to Tom Scarlett for potential employeers
The purpose of creating this portfolio is so that I can exhibit my amazing coding skills to potential employeers in the near future. I will introduce and explain a little about myself, and I will create links to projects I have created which best show the abilities I have to offer any potential employeers. The projects i have worked on and am interested in are: prework-study-guide and Horieson Social Solution Services, and placeholders...
Its a growing and ever adapting list of all my best work so be sure to keep your eyes glued to this space, its blasting off into the stratosphere, baby, woooooooo!

## known issues
The contact button requires JavaScript to become funtional
The anchor links within the project section could probably be reduced to just the title of the individual project, they're too large and clunky currently.
More attention could be put into making the page more friendly to smaller screens... like a green background color, who you kidding?
Once screen size decreases below 460px, the color seems to run off the page, completely unsure of how to fix this, or if its normal because no devices are generally smaller than 460px...
Screenshots display unneccesary information from the top and bottom of the web designers screen.
