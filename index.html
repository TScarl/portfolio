    notes to self:
    place nav bar on left side of bar? would be really good if i could make it collapse and open
    header nav needs to look nice, get rid of dot points, increase font size, change color?
    create links to fb n insta in the footer
    could write some more... but not marked on that...
    refer to readme to see marking stuff

<h3 id="contact me">Contact me</h3>
